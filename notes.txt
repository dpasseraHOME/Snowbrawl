Next
- refactor sprite sheet
	- one action per row
	- uniform row heights and column widths
- trigger specific animations (use buttons as placeholder interface)
- interruptable idle animation
- size canvas to fit sprite frame
- layer multiple canvases
	- any performance degradation, if 12 sprites are doing their idle animations?
	- if so, have frames without animation
- character class?
