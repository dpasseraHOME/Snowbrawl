- idle animations for each - array of intervals? or one loop that runs through all sprites then calls itself at the end?
	- isPendingActionArr is checked on each run through the loop.  If isPendingAction for any given character, all that char is reset and new animation is played
- refactor as character objects, rather than using arrays

- Can I write a jQuery plugin for sprite animation?  How would I do it for multiple sprites?
	- $.SpriteManager({
				"sprite1":
						{sheet:"images/sheet1.gif",
						anim:["idle","walk","throw"]},
				"sprite2":
						{sheet:"images/sheet2.gif",
						anim:["idle","walk","throw"]}
	})
